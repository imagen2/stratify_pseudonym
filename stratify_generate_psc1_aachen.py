"""Generate codes to pseudonymize Stratify B data.

The algorithm used here is certainly brain-dead. This is not reusable code
but is good enough for a one-shot run. I spent 10 minutes writing and it
took ~ 3 days to generate PSC1 codes for the Stratify B project.

    The numeric codes are made of:
    - a prefix made from one of the `prefixes`
    - a main code made of `digits` digits
    - a Damm check digit as a suffix

    Parameters
    ----------
    prefix : dict
        Keys are the expected prefixes - strings made of digits.
        Values represent the expected number of codes for each prefix.

    digits : int
        Number of digits the main code is made of.

    min_distance : int
        Minimal Damerau-Levenshtein distance between generated strings.

    existing : set
        Set of existing, previously assigned PSC1 codes to take into account.

    -------
    dict
